=

This sample is part of a [tutorial](https://medium.com/@nimroddayan/android-and-dagger-2-10-androidinjector-5e9c523679a3) how to use the new [dagger-android](https://google.github.io/dagger/android.html) module, which was released in Dagger 2.10.

The sample demonstrates key points when working with Dagger in the context of MVP:

* How to inject an Activity
* How to bind the activity where a View is requested
* How to bind @Named arguments that are passed from the activity and provide them in the Presenter
